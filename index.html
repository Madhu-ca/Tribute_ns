                        The fifth child of his parents Shesha Karantha and Lakshmamma, he completed his primary education in Kundapura and Mangalore.  Shivaram Karanth 
                        was influenced by Gandhi's principles and took part in Indian Independence movement when he was in college. His participation in the Non-cooperation 
                        movement did not allow him to complete his college education. He canvassed for Khadi and Swadeshi in Karnataka. By that time, Karanth had already started writing fiction novels 
                        and plays.

                        Ade Ooru Ade Mara, Shaneeshwarana Neralinalli, Kudiyara Koosu, Svapnada Hole, Sarsammana Samadhi, and Chomana Dudi are widely read and have received critical acclaim.He was involved 
                        in experiments in the technique of printing for some years in the 1930s and 1940s and printed his own novels.Shivaram Karanth used to write plays 
                        specifically for the students of the school and train them in acting. Yakshagana shows were also held in the school grounds as part of the Puttur Dasara festivities 
                        that used to take place between 1934 and 1944. Yakshagana shows, which typically run all night, are an intrinsic  part of coastal Karnataka's history. They combine dance, music, dialogue, costume, make-up, and stage techniques, and involve stories from epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata.He was also a painter and was deeply 
                        concerned with the issue of nuclear energy and its impact on the environment.

                        and daughters, Malavika and Kshama.A loving, devoted father, he enriched his children's childhood with impromptu stories, handmade toys, songs, 
                        dance and drama. He took his children, and later grandchildren, 
                        with him during his endless travels and opened up the worlds of history, archaeology, sculpture and environment for them.
