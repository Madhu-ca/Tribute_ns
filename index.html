                    as K. Shivaram Karanth, was an Indian polymath, who was a novelist in Kannada 
                    language, social activist, ecological conservationist, playwright, Yakshagana artist, film maker and thinker.He has been one of the 
                    finest novelists-activists since independence".He was the third writer to be 
                    decorated with the <span style="font-weight:bold ;">Jnanpith Award for Kannada</span>, the highest literary honor conferred
                    in India. He is called as<span style="font-weight:bold ;"> Kadala teerada bhargava</span> and also<span style="font-weight:bold ;"> Nadedaduva Vishwakosha</span>.

                <br>
                <p id="p1">Shivaram Karanth was born on 10 October 1902, in Kota near Kundapura in the Udupi district of Karnataka to a Kannada-speaking family. 
                    The fifth child of his parents Shesha Karantha and Lakshmamma, he completed his primary education in Kundapura and Mangalore.  Shivaram Karanth 
                    was influenced by Gandhi's principles and took part in Indian Independence movement when he was in college. His participation in the Non-cooperation 
                    movement did not allow him to complete his college education which he quit in February 1922. He canvassed for Khadi and Swadeshi in Karnataka led by 
                    Indian National Congress leader Karnad Sadashiva Rao, for five years till 1927. By that time, Karanth had already started writing fiction novels 
                    and plays.
                    <br><br>
                    He was involved in experiments in the technique of printing for some years in the 1930s and 1940s and printed his own novels.Shivaram Karanth used to write plays 
                    specifically for the students of the school and train them in acting. Yakshagana shows were also held in the school grounds as part of the Puttur Dasara festivities 
                    that used to take place between 1934 and 1944. Yakshagana shows, which typically run all night, are an intrinsic

        <p id="p2"> part of coastal Karnataka's history. They combine dance, music, dialogue, costume, make-up, and stage techniques, and involve stories from epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata.He was also a painter and was deeply 
            concerned with the issue of nuclear energy and its impact on the environment.

        <br>

        <p id="p2">Karanth married Leela Alva, a student in the school that Karanth taught dance and directed plays in.
            She was the backbone of all his endeavours. She was also quite well-read, and she dedicated all of her talents to her husband. 
            The Karanths had four children together: sons, Harsha and Ullas, a conservationist; and daughters, Malavika and Kshama.
            A loving, devoted father, he enriched his children's childhood with impromptu stories, handmade toys, songs, 
            dance and drama; at times a short-tempered disciplinarian, who mostly ensured their freedom, and the 
            right to pursue their individual “madnesses” as he himself had done.The children now rightly claim 
            that they were successful products of his innovative teaching. His system was to allow children to nourish their curiosity 
            about nature and acquire minimum literacy and numeracy through a bit of formal learning. He took his children, and later grandchildren, 
            with him during his endless travels and opened up the worlds of history, archaeology, sculpture and environment for them.
            He suffered from a cardiac respiratory arrest and died on 9 December 1997.
