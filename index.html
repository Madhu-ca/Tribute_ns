                    <p id="p1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kota Shivaram Karanth</span>(10 October 1902 – 9 December 1997), also abbreviated 
                    as K. Shivaram Karanth, was an Indian polymath, who was a novelist in Kannada 
                    language, social activist, ecological conservationist, playwright, Yakshagana artist, film maker and thinker.He has been one of the 
                    finest novelists-activists since independence".He was the third writer to be 
                    decorated with the Jnanpith Award for Kannada, the highest literary honor conferred
                    in India.He is called as<span style="font-weight: 550;">Kadala teerada bhargava</span>and also<span style="font:400px;">Nadedaduva Vishwakosha</span>.
                </p>

                <p id="p1">He was involved in experiments in the technique of printing for some years in the 
                    1930s and 1940s and printed his own novels.Shivaram Karanth used to write plays specifically for the students of the school and train them in acting. Yakshagana shows were also held in the school grounds as part of the Puttur Dasara festivities that used to take place between 1934 and 1944. Yakshagana shows, which typically run all night, are an intrinsic part of coastal Karnataka's history. They combine dance, music, dialogue, costume, make-up, and stage techniques, 
                    and involve stories from epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata.He was also a painter and was deeply 
                    concerned with the issue of nuclear energy and its impact on the environment.

            A loving, devoted father, he enriched his children's childhood with impromptu stories, handmade toys, songs, 
            dance and drama; at times a short-tempered disciplinarian, who mostly ensured their freedom, and the 
            right to pursue their individual “madnesses” as he himself had done.The children now rightly claim 
            that they were successful products of his innovative teaching. His system was to allow children to nourish their curiosity about nature and acquire minimum literacy and numeracy through a bit of formal learning. He took his children, and later grandchildren, with him during his endless travels and opened up the worlds of history, archaeology, sculpture and environment for them.
